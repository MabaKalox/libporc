# libporc
Library to aid in padding oracle attacks.
Supports both direct padding oracle and timing-based attack using mean / median of multiple measurements.
See `example.cpp` for usage.

To use it in your PoC, `make all` then link with `libporc.a`.

Not intended for any illegal activities, but you know I can't stop you :-(
